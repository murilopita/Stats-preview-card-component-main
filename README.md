# My process

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive Design

<br>

## What I learned

I learned the basics of 'Flexbox' and how to use it for a responsive webpage. Also I began my studies about 'Media Queries' and how to use them.

<br>

## Continued development

I'll keep practicing more about 'Media Queries, cause in this challenge I had some doubts and struggles with them in the process of this challenge. Please, be welcome to give me your feedback, tips or anything.
